✅ Introduction:
NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.

✅ Key Features:
ndarray: Core data structure for fast and memory-efficient arrays.

Mathematical Functions: Supports statistical, algebraic, and trigonometric operations.

Broadcasting: Allows arithmetic between arrays of different shapes.

Indexing and Slicing: Access parts of arrays efficiently.

Integration: Works well with other libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

✅ Installation:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy
✅ Basic Operations:
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

# Creating arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Arithmetic operations
sum_ab = a + b
product = a * b

# Matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Shape and size
matrix.shape     # (2, 2)
matrix.size      # 4

# Useful functions
np.mean(a)
np.max(b)
np.zeros((2, 3))
np.ones(5)
✅ Commonly Used Functions:
Function	Description
np.array()	Create an array
np.arange()	Range of numbers as array
np.linspace()	Evenly spaced numbers in a range
np.reshape()	Change shape of an array
np.sum(), np.mean()	Aggregate operations
np.dot()	Matrix multiplication
